- You will need to download node if you haven't yet. 
- You will need to download mysql if you haven't yet. 
- You will need to get the current sql insert (ask me for it)

# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Change mysql connection details 
in the server.js file change the password to match your mysql password

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

0) Be sure to pull current code

2) Then make your changes and push to your forked repository 
3) Now you can make a pull request with your changes. 
4) Changes will be reviewed and added in (most of the time)
